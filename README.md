# Black Jack in C++
Using C++ to play Black Jack in the command prompt.  May expand to allow users to play more card games in the future.

## Why C++?
C++ is the language I used in my college coursework, and I have yet to do literally anything with it.  This is my attempt to create something cool with it.  

## Why did you make your own ArrayStack class?
Another thing I was taught in my coursework, which yes is pointless because I could just use something like a Vector.  I started this project some years ago, and back then I decided to just build an ArrayStack from scratch for the sake of making things more challenging I guess.  I am sticking to it
